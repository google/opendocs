# Working with a technical writer

Here are some guidelines to help open source organizations work effectively wit
technical writers.

### Introduce the technical writer to the world of open source and to your community

*   Give the technical writer a 'guided tour' of your community. Where can they
ask questions? What regular meetings should they attend, or what mailing lists
should they join? What accounts do they need (Github, Discord, Slack)? Make sure
they understand your project's code of conduct, and know how to report any
problems. Make sure your technical writer understands the license of your
project, and complies with any requirements of other employers around signing
CLAs, DCOs, or other agreements.
*   If possible, introduce them to a few people in overlapping time zones who
can respond quickly to questions about the community or project.
*   If you can, send them some project swag!

### Help the technical writer use the tools and processes involved in contributing to your project

*   If your processes aren't well-documented, set up a time to walk the
technical writer through their first contribution, issue, or pull request.
What templates or tags should they use? Who needs to review their contribution,
and how and when should they follow up on reviews? If their work includes code
samples, how can they be tested? What do they need to know about your CI/CD
process or releases?

### Help the technical writer understand your project and its users

*   Explain your project in detail so that the technical writer gains a firm
conceptual understanding of the product. This can help the technical writer
feel more confident and be more authoritative in their writing for the project.
*   Describe the needs of the people who use the project. Be as specific as you
can—not just 'developers' but 'developers creating web sites' and 'developers
programming industrial robots'.
*   Put the technical writer in touch with the necessary subject matter experts.
That is, the developers or other project contributors responsible for the
aspects of your project that the documentation will cover.
*   Ensure that the technical writer gets the time and resources they need from
the subject matter experts and any other community members.

### Ask questions!

*   Your community or project may not have worked with technical writers or
documentation contributors before. Take advantage of the opportunity to learn
while you share what you know! Ask for feedback on your processes and tools—your
technical writer will likely have some suggestions for improvement.
