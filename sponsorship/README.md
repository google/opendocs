# [Sponsorship reporting toolkit](https://github.com/google/opendocs/blob/main/sponsorship/README.md)

A resource to help you develop or improve communications with potential and active sponsors of your open source organization. 

This toolkit provides a templates of content to consider when seeking and supporting active sponsorships of your organization in service to an open source community:

- A [sponsor prospectus](sponsor-prospectus.md) explains what kind of support you are asking for.
- A [sponsor event report](sponsor-event-report.md) provides sponsors with information about how useful their sponsorship was for a single event, such as a contributor sprint or conference.
- A [sponsor annual feedback report](sponsor-annual-feedback.md) guides your sponsors to understand how impactful their specific sponsorship was for your organization.

What you include in your documents, and how you present that will depend on the resources available to you as well as the information that is important to your sponsors.

When in doubt, ask your sponsors what information helps them to make decisions about when and where to invest.
