# The Invention

This project type focuses on making especially creative or distinctive works that supplement or extend traditional prose docs.
This includes diagrams, illustrations, photography, stories, comics, zines, and games for your open source software.
This type of project is strongly oriented to the medium of the work, typically by collaborating with a specific artist, storyteller, or game designer.

_The Invention_ is often preceded by:

- [The Study](./study.md), to learn about what audiences would be helped by non-traditional docs
- [The Manual](./manual.md), to write docs that may be supplemented by diagrams, illustrations, or other artwork

_The Invention_ is sometimes difficult to estimate for size or duration.
Consider testing the work with [The Prototype](./prototype.md).

_The Invention_ is often followed by [The Show](./show.md), where illustrations are used as supporting material for video.

## Audience

This type of project benefits:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Audience</th>
      <th>Frequency</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Users of your software</td>
      <td>Sometimes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Third-party developers and administrators</td>
      <td>Sometimes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Contributors to your software and docs</td>
      <td>Sometimes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## When to do this project

Do this project to solve problems such as:

- Your open source software or its problem domain is difficult to explain by relying solely on text or screenshots.
  For example, your software is itself a tool for 3-D modeling and graphics.

- You’re unable to reach an audience that is unaccustomed to, uninterested in, or bored reading typical open source docs.
  For example, your software is a tool for visual artists who typically work in non-digital media.

This project is often triggered by a contributor volunteering a specific skill.
For example, a cartoonist is a regular contributor to your software and they have volunteered to create a cartoon to embed in the docs.

## Tasks and deliverables

You have finished this type of project when you’ve completed tasks such as:

- Audience analysis, such as finding out who’s going to use or contribute to your open source software, what motivates them, the things they already know about, and what they might need to learn (sometimes as a project of its own, [The Study](./study.md))
- Identifying types of work to be created
- Creating a production plan, such as outlining the progression from concept through sketches or mockups to the final deliverables
- Doing the writing, designing, coding, drawing, or other creative effort
- Writing alternative text or satisfying other accessibility requirements
- User testing
- Revising
- Reviewing and giving feedback
- Preparing the work for publishing (for example, committing the completed assets to your Git repository)
- Publishing the work
- Announcing and promoting the work

You probably won’t do all of these steps.
Choose the ones that make the most sense for your goals, available skills and resources, and timeline.

### Out of Scope

Some tasks aren’t part of this project type, such as:

- Writing the docs that underlie this work ([The Manual](./manual.md))
- Creating code samples or demos that underlie this work ([The Widget](./widget.md))

Avoid including this work in _The Invention_.
Break it out into its own project.

## Key people

A contributor with skills and expertise in the target medium, format, or genre often does this work.
This type of project is often driven by the availability and specific skills of such a contributor.

A good fit for this work has a vision.
It’s common for the chief contributor to this project to work independently, without requiring the same level of feedback as ordinary code contributions.
The drive to complete the work is likely to originate with the contributor who does the work, not general maintainers.

Subject matter experts, such as the developers who implement new features, are essential contributors to this work.
They should expect to answer questions, participate in informational interviews, demo functionality, or conduct technical review.

Others contribute to this work. In your plan, don’t forget to include:

- Team leadership
- Code and docs reviewers
- Support roles, such as community managers, foundation leaders, and fiscal and other sponsors (and sponsor staff, such as finance, recruiters, sysadmins, or legal)

## Delay and failure risks

This project type is at most risk from key people becoming unavailable.
Other sources of risk are less common.

Risks include:

- Key people become unavailable.
  This project type often hinges on a few key contributors.
  Prioritize time-to-publish over completeness to hedge against unexpected departures.

- Excess ambition.
  This type of project often originates with a single enthusiastic volunteer, who might have more enthusiasm at the project’s beginning than its end.
  Avoid relying too much on the results of the work or tying it directly to other projects.
  For example, don’t condition a major release on the completion of decorative artwork.

- Stakeholder skepticism.
  Some stakeholders may be reluctant to direct resources to non-traditional non-code contributions.
  Depending on your project’s culture, consider allocating extra time for discussions or using alternative contribution arrangements (for example, housing creative work in a separate repository) to accommodate community expectations.

- Lack of familiarity with deliverables.
  Reviewers may not know how to give useful feedback, leading to feedback or acceptance criteria that is too restrictive or too deferential.
  Before work begins, discuss what feedback is useful, how it will be used, and what constitutes blocking or non-blocking issues.

- Scope creep.
  This kind of project is often novel and exciting, leading to excess enthusiasm and invitations to widen the scope.
  Resist the urge.
  Repeating a successful creative project is more likely to succeed than modifying a successful project in progress.
