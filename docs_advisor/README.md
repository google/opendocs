# Docs Advisor

*Docs Advisor* is a resource that brings together advice, methods, and tips from people who work on all kinds of documentation and information challenges to help open source maintainers make better documentation. It includes insights from a wide-ranging analysis of case studies produced by participants in Google's multi-year [Season of Docs program](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs), which has now concluded.

## Introduction 

_“Documentation is a multiplier for your efforts. Every time you write something down, a million people can read it and you don't have to talk to a million people.” —CouchDB maintainer Jan Lehnardt_

The effects of good documentation are quantifiable. [Research from DORA](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/deep-dive-into-2022-state-of-devops-report-on-documentation) found that [high-quality internal documentation](https://dora.dev/research/2023/dora-report/) boosts team performance by 25% and correlates with improvements in teams’ [capacities and practices across the board](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/deep-dive-into-2022-state-of-devops-report-on-documentation). DORA researchers also found that having high-quality documentation is associated with decreased burnout and increased productivity. Good docs exert a positive influence over every part of the FOSS ecosystem: 

* **Adoption:** When Tidelift surveyed developers in 2019 on the factors guiding their choice of FOSS packages, [72% listed documentation](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4008838/Resources/The-2019-Tidelift-managed-open-source-survey-results.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_content=76541577&utm_source=hs_automation&hsCtaTracking=4eec8e61-f6ea-42aa-9105-2654a6537299%7C1b61952f-9b9b-42d8-bca3-476eccd649b4) as a key factor.

* **Contributions:** [GitHub found that](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2024/) for 83% of developers, whether a project had a contributor’s guide was an important factor in deciding which projects to contribute to.

* **Learning to code:** [Stack Overflow’s 2024 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/developer-profile#learning-to-code) found that even as AI became a major resource for people learning to code, technical documentation was still the most important resource.  Of developers surveyed, 37% of developers used AI tools, 68% used “written tutorials,” and 84% of developers used some form of project documentation. 

Experienced developers and maintainers know that docs are valuable, even when they struggle to find the time and resources to create or fix their own. In an interview, one longtime maintainer went further:

> The multiplication effect of good documentation is so ridiculous that most software engineers should write only documentation. The efficiency is like a hundred to one! Every line of code, write a hundred lines of documentation and you still come out ahead in terms of effectively scaling your efforts.

In an ideal world, every FOSS project would be supported by user experience researchers and designers, technical writers, and community leads who could fill gaps in maintainers’ expertise and help each project thrive. [In reality](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/4008838/Resources/2021_Tidelift_Maintainer_Survey_FINAL.pdf), many FOSS maintainers are [overcommitted, under-resourced](https://tidelift.com/open-source-maintainer-survey-2023), and [on the verge of exhaustion](https://medium.com/better-programming/why-open-source-developers-are-burning-out-1a860854884c). 

In interviews, blog posts, talks, and forum comments, maintainers emphasize that documentation can improve the quality of their projects—and their own quality of life. Still, many maintainers find that without dedicated resources and expertise, it’s difficult to actually do the work. 

This guide is intended to demystify the work of good documentation. It collects practices and processes from within **technical writing and docs communities** and from **user experience**, **information architecture**, and **content strategy**—in ways that are approachable, flexible, and suitable for mixing and matching. It won’t pretend to comprehensively cover any of these fields’ practices. Think of it as a connection to friends in many fields on whom you can call for advice as you untangle and improve your docs.

### How to use this guide

You can think of this guide as a menu with several courses. Within each section, you can pick the approach that makes the most sense for you, then move to the next. If you’re pressed for time, skim the introduction of each section to familiarize yourself with the recommended options, then work through the details as you need them. 

* In [Part 1](part_1.md), you’ll pick an overall approach that suits the needs of your project. 
* In [Part 2](part_2.md), you’ll learn enough about your community and their needs to ensure that your hard work will be helping real people.
* In [Part 3](part_3.md), you’ll assess your existing resources and pull together everything you need to move quickly and confidently through the work of creating and revising your docs.
* In [Part 4](part_4.md), you’ll get to work writing and revising your docs and set yourself to successfully evaluate your work and maintain it.

**Note:** Throughout this guide, you’ll find links to many external, in-depth resources. Technical writer Daniel Beck’s [Documentation Project Archetypes](https://github.com/google/opendocs/blob/main/project_archetypes/README.md) deserve a special mention. Created in parallel with this guide, Beck’s resource concisely presents various modes of documentation work as interconnected but self-contained archetypes or units. Each archetype can help you think concretely about how to approach your work, and this guide links to the archetypes at key decision points.

And now, in [Part 1](part_1.md), you’ll be picking an overall approach to the work before you.
