# Docs Advisor docs plan template

## Approach

How will you accomplish your documentation work? (From [Part 1](part_1.md) of *Docs Advisor*)

* What approach will you take to your documentation work, as a whole? (Planless iteration, mini-overhaul, heroic overhaul, something else.)

* What risks do you need to mitigate?

* Are there any documents to make or steps to perform to increase your chances of success?

## Who are your users?

Who uses your project’s outputs? (From [Part 2](part_2.md) of *Docs Advisor*)

* What do you know (or suspect) about them and their documentation needs, off the top of your head? 

* What kind of range of expertise do you see or expect to see? 

* What kinds of conceptual potholes do they tend to fall into? 

* What things about the project do you find yourself explaining repeatedly? Which of those things are within your project’s remit, and which are external?

Who are your contributors and potential contributors? 

* What do you know (or suspect) about them and their documentation needs, off the top of your head? 

* What kind of range of expertise do you see or expect to see? 

* What kinds of conceptual potholes do they tend to fall into? 

* Which of those things are within your project’s remit, and which are external?

Who are the project’s maintainers?

* What are your big unmet needs as a maintainer? Do any of those needs connect—directly or indirectly—with your documentation?

* If you have a team of maintainers, what’s the range of expertise on the team? Do your docs support the needs of the whole range of experience, including the newest additions? 

Do DORA’s measures of documentation quality make sense for your project? How would you adapt them to reflect your project’s needs? 

* Reliable
* Clear
* Findable
* Comprehensive
* Organized
* Up-to-date
* Accurate
* Relevant

## What did you learn in user research? 

Re-read transcripts or comments, review videos or interview notes, and summarize what you’ve learned about what each target group of people needs from your documentation. (From [Part 2](part_2.md) of *Docs Advisor*)

Elements to write down:

* a list of users you connected with and groups they represent  
* notes and summaries from interviews, observations, any survey results, including:  
  * what docs work well now for various user groups?  
  * what docs are missing or unhelpful? if they’re unhelpful, why and how? (and for whom?)  
  * which information is hard to find?  
  * did your research participants explicitly ask for any changes?  
  * what else did you learn? 

## Priorities

What is the most important community or group for the project’s growth and survival? What about the next-most crucial community or group? Rank your user groups and then, for each one, list their major unmet needs. Make sure your needs as a maintainer are included in that list. (From [Part 3](part_3.md) of *Docs Advisor*)

More things to consider when prioritizing needs:

* Did your research uncover something so broken you have to fix it before you can do anything else? Top priority\!
* Needs that, if met, would immediately improve your life as a maintainer? Consider making them a top priority, too—boosting your efficiency, productivity, or morale will have ripple effects across the whole project.
* Check for potential efficiency boosts: looking *across* group needs, can you see the same needs popping up across multiple groups? Consider boosting priority for those.
* Did you find unmet needs that you’re comfortable putting off indefinitely or classing as out of scope? Take them off your priority list and put them in a backlog.

## Project goals

Based on what you’ve learned so far, what are the overall goals for your documentation project? Choose realistic, clear goals that you’ll be able to tell if you’ve met or not. (From [Part 3](part_3.md) of *Docs Advisor*.) 

You can refer back to the approach you selected in [Part 1](part_1.md) to shape your list of goals.

* If you’re doing **Planless Iteration**, your top-level goals might include:
  * adopting or building a style guide and example docs that all docs contributors can refer back to, 
  * modeling the practice of continuous docs improvement by dedicating two (or four, or six) hours a week to docs revisions and docs-related PR reviews, and
  *  meeting 80% of your top-priority users’ documented needs within 30 (or 60, or 90\) days. 

* If you’re doing a **Mini-Overhaul project focused meeting the needs of new and potential contributors**, your top-level goals might be to:
  * create a more comprehensive and welcoming Contributor Guide, 
  * reorganize your existing docs for new contributors, and 
  * clean up all your issue templates in GitHub. 

* If you’re doing a **Heroic Overhaul**, your top-level goals might be to:
  * restructure all your documentation to improve findability, 
  * get rid of old and outdated material, 
  * refresh all your tutorials to work better for your top-priority users, 
  * write targeted guides for each of your three main groups of users, and 
  * bring all your reference documentation up to date with the codebase.
    
## Meta-documentation

Did you write, adopt, or adapt any guidance for how your documentation should feel and sound? This could include communication guidelines for the project as a whole, a voice and style guide for the documentation work, accessibility guidance, or other meta-documentation. (From [Part 3](part_3.md) of *Docs Advisor*.) 

## Documentation inventory & assessment

What method did you use to inventory and evaluate your existing documentation, if you have any? Link to your inventory and gap analysis if you did them, or to other forms of audits or assessments. (From [Part 3](part_3.md) of *Docs Advisor*.) 

## Organization

What kinds of documentation will you produce? Will you adopt or adapt the Diátaxis approach, or use different one? How will you organize this documentation on your docs site? (From [Part 3](part_3.md) of *Docs Advisor*.) 

## Assembling your docs team

Who is available to write, revise, edit, and publish your documentation? (From [Part 3](part_3.md) of *Docs Advisor*.) 

* How much of your time is available?   
* How much of other primary/lead maintainers’ time?  
* How much support for the docs work can you muster from others in your community, if you make an effort to organize them? (What would that effort look like?)  
* Can you bring in technical writers to help?  
  * Do you have room in your budget for a technical writer?  
  * Are you aware of any grants or other funding that could help with this?
